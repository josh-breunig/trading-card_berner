			<p class="interesting">Despite the sleepy picture... Bernese Mountain Dogs are very hard workers and used to act as delivery dogs.  They would pull carts filled with various farm products from town to town.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><span>Temperament</span>: Good-Natured, Calm, Strong</li>
				<li><span>Weight</span>: 80-115 pounds (male), 70-95 pounds (female)</li>
				<li><span>Life Expectancy</span>: 7-10 years</li>
				<li><span>Origin</span>: Switzerland</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Bernese Mountain Dog is a large, sturdy worker who can stand over 27 inches at the shoulder. The thick, silky, and moderately long coat is tricolored: jet black, clear white, and rust. The distinctive markings on the coat and face are breed hallmarks and, combined with the intelligent gleam in the dark eyes, add to the Bernerâ€™s aura of majestic nobility.</p>
